        <h1>GreenPlate: A Sustainable Food Management System</h1>
        <p>In the modern day, it is difficult to adequately eat and shop in a sustainable way. 
            Therefore, we have a two-sided goal. We both want to reduce food waste while we simultaneously promote efficient
        use of the resources and food that someone already has. Users can upload recipes and ingredients and continously monitor the food they have,
    expiration dates, and what recipes they can make. We wrap this all in an easy-to-use app with an account management system utilizing Firebase as our login
and database system.</p>

        <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
        <p>We used a variety of OOP design schemes which have been documented below. Our architecture works by having users log in and then using a UID to connect their information to everything in the Firebase database seen below.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions and Reflections/Learning</h2>
        <p>In the end, we created our app successfuly with the ability to manage recipes, ingredients, and accounts overall. This gives 
            people the ability to monitor the foods they have and allows them to be more sustainable overall. All members of the group contributed
            equally in building out this site and the app and all helped with the coding and design. Learning about how to collaborate effectively
            was a lot of fun. The main challenge we faced was in using the Android Game Studio syntax. We knew what we wanted to build but reading through
            documentation to figure out how to implement that was definitely not easy. Overall, this was a fun process. We learned a lot about object oriented building
            practices and hope to take this knowledge further in our careers.
